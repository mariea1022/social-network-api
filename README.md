# 18 NoSQL: Social Network API
![Github license](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

## Description
The task was to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list.

For this application, I used MongoDB, which is a schema-less NoSQL document database, and so to add structure to my data, I used Mongoose to define my schemas and models.
